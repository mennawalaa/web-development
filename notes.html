          this example
          note this is an inline style and when its is used as attribute in li or p its considered a part of html
          language

    <h1>css
    </h1>
    <p style="color:rgb(70, 5, 18)">the WEB browser translates your html code to a tree structure
      called DOM (DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL)tree with one root a head and multiple nodes each node can have only on input
      arrow</p>
    <img class="bigbox" src="https://www.w3schools.com/js/pic_htmltree.gif" ,alt="cannot display image ">
    <p class="bigbox"> css styling is responsable for the way the tree is transformed to the padge appearing on web
      browser
      ex :the elements of the list are being organized vertically or horisontally
      css syntax composed of rule set {selector{declarations{attributes:values}}}</p>
    <h2>CSS notes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li> font-size: 1.5em make the text bigger by 1.5 times its previous value
      <li> selector can be a type li{},or a class .vip{},or specific id #unique{}
      <li>to call the class or id you add atttribute class or id to your element <p class="special">implemented example
          ofr a class p see the code html</p>
      <li>css use pixels to measure and describe web padge screen its really the hard ware pixels
        1 inch=96 css pixels ,1cm=37.8 css pixels,there is another unit named pt,1 inch=72 pt, em unit equal to the font
        size text in the element
      <li>dimenstions can be a rathio from the web badge size like width:50%
      <li> this a refrence for css material <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference">click
          here</a>
      <li>we cannot write css code inside html because its a different language ,however there are three ways to use css
        with html

        <ol>
          <li>use the css command as an attribute style with html elements
          <li>write css code inside style element in the head of html file
          <li>write css code in a separet file and include it in the html file using like element in the head of the
            file
        </ol>
      <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp">this the color picker link</a>
      <li>when choosing the font type ,one can choose a type font that doesnt exist in the webserver
        so ,the browser would use the default font type which could different from what the designer whats
        in order to avoid this we can use generic css font-family with general types that if the bowser
        didnt have the specific font he uses the general css family specficed like monospace,serif
        or one can use google web fonts types whcih doesnt need to be loaded on the computer
        full document for google web font use <a href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/getting_started">get
          started</a>
        <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">fonts availabe</a>
      <li> those are some font parameters
        font-weight: bold;<br>
        font-style: italic;<br>
        font-size: 14pt;<br>
        text-decoration: underline;<br>
      <li class="vip">font commands can be embedded in one line in specfic proiroty order the order can be found on
        <a href="this handy page from the CSS-Tricks website.">click here</a>
      <li class="vip">if font properties are not in correct order thsi cause <strong>gotcha</strong>:means a code seems
        right but it causes
        a mistake
      <li>flexbox is property to fit boxs into a container with various configurations to read more about
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Using_CSS_flexible_boxes">see
          the following link</a>
      <li class="vip">algin-element align elements along cross axis ,while jusitfy content align element along main axis
      <li>grid is nice to use to set the whole padge layout ,while flexbox is nice to set the flow of the inner boxes
